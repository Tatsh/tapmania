Well, after working with Sanxion7 in my 2nd entry, I have another chance to use another song of his. The song is awesome, reminds me of "Xenon", with a little bit "A" touch. The piano sound in the middle of the song is nothing, but beautiful. Heheh.. Thanks again to Sanxion7 (Saxxxonpike) for letting me work with his song one more time.

Single-Beginner:
It's 3-foot. Nothing's spectacular here, but for those who are beginners, this step must be pretty challenging since it has rather high stream for beginner level.

Single-Easy:
Just like Beginner level, but with advanced jumps and two and more 16th notes.

Single-Standard:
I intended myself to make an intermediate steps for the Standards, so here it is, 7-foot hard. It has plenty of 8th notes, also some freezes and jumps. Quite technical for standard players.

Single-Heavy:
What really inspires me is the gallops in the middle of the song. Since entered my first entry for StepMix 2, I had wanted to have gallops on my works but never experienced that much on it. So this is my accomplisment. Not too many gallops, but quite technical. Also, I really love the stream part in the song bridge. With the background changing. It's awesome.

Single-Challenge:
Didn't boost it into level 10. I'm more satisfied with 9, which is unique, different from others. With some holds/freezes that are quite technical, a harder stream part than Heavy steps, it becomes really fun to play. Watch out the high voltage, chaos, and stream at the finale part of the song. 

Double-Beginner:
Just like the Single. Quite hard for beginner players. 

Double-Easy:
This is the version of Single Easy, but with more jumps, and less 8th notes. The jumps is hard for even standard players, I think. The note placements is quite remote. 

Double-Standard:
Like the Single, it's really fun to play. For those who have expertise the Singles-Heavy and just start play doubles, this is the one.

Double-Heavy:
Gallops again. With harder note placements. You got to turn your body often to play this.

Double-Standard:
The final achievement. Feel the difficulty of Single-Challenge in 8 pad-play. And still watch out the finale part of the song.

Pump-Challenge:
Hehehe.. I planned of working on Solo actually, but since the automatic conversion from Single to Solo is quite perfect, so I changed my mind. I made this Pump It Up steps. Challenge only. The reason is, I also have been playing PiU for over 4 years, really good at it (I can finish Moonlight Nightmare, still this year world champion is demon.. hehehehe..). So I made this step. In PiU standard, this step is rated about 15-16-17. I think 16 is the most propper rating for this step. But, I got confused anyway when converting it to SM standard, so I think it's 11 due to many jumps that must hold 3 or more pads in the same time. It's really PiU style, with many handplants, many 16th notes, the body rotation is also so PiU. You should try. It's fun.

Thanks for my very talented brother for giving me the chance to use his photograph! You must see his website at http://arhcamtilnaad.deviantart.com. It is full of great works: digital arts, photography, etc.
Howeever, he refused to make the background and banners, so I had to make them by myself. 
I did some cropping and flipping at Photoshop, and so and so.. add some letter mask, etc. So here they are. Catchy, powerful, and RED. Hehe.. Oh.. And look at the cat eyes. Stunning. I really also love the banner anyway. ;) Thanks to Photoshop CS2. Hehe.


That's all, folks. Enjoy!
