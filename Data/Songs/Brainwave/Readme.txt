The song was made by me. It was originally created as an request for someone, and its intent was to mimic Eurobeat to a certain degree. Afterwards, a longer version was implemented for my pseudo-album, and now this version has been modified slightly. If you have heard the original, changes include adding some synths and changing some percussion.

=========================

Singles

Beginner (2):

Standard beginner material. Simplified version of Basic with repeating arrows in the style of classic DDR.

Basic (4):

All quarter notes, a few jumps and freezes. Most quarter notes repeat twice.

Another (6):

A few 8th note triplets and more freezes than Basic, especially around the later half of the song.

Maniac (8):

The introduction focuses on rhythm with some 16th note clusters. This is followed by some 8th note streams combined with minor handplants that can be avoided with judicious timing. The following sections has a strong focus on handplants, mostly the ones formed by 4 freezes arrows in a row. This is followed by a section focusing on gallops, and then going back to 8th note streams and minor handplants. The ending follows the beat.

Oni (10):

Changes from Maniac include mines, harder introduction section, a stronger focus on handplants and a slightly more difficult gallop section.
