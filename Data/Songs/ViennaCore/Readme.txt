++ BEGINNER 

Foot rating: StepMania estimate rate: 2.034361 || Own criteria: 2
Groove radar: 0.142 stream || 0.202 voltage || 0.085 air || 0.096 freeze || 0.000 chaos 
Steps: 84 notes || 9 hold notes 

What can I say about this? It's just a combination of lefts-rights and ups-downs, 2 mid-scales
and a few jumps and freezes to start a speed song.


++ LIGHT

Foot rating: StepMania estimate rate: 3.657475 || Own criteria: 4
Groove radar: 0.292 stream || 0.337 voltage || 0.117 air || 0.214 freeze || 0.000 chaos 
Steps: 171 notes || 20 hold notes 

This light stepchart is made with many basic patterns that can finish with a single freeze note
or a basic jump (no corner jumps to not kill to the kid). It also contains many double single
steps like left-left-up or right-right-down to give the sensation of speed in the game. In the
final part of the song I added a slow spin before the basic double taps. Now you can see, it's
a basic 4 foot to play a speed song.


++ STANDARD

Foot rating: StepMania estimate rate: 6.114196 || Own criteria: 6
Groove radar: 0.504 stream || 0.505 voltage || 0.535 air || 0.289 freeze || 0.000 chaos 
Steps: 303 notes || 27 hold notes

Maybe it's not the perfect midway between light and heavy when you see the comparison in
the groove radar, but if you play standard a couple of times, you can find the big difference
that says why it's not like heavy with less notes. The beginning is similar to heavy, but 
instead of change completely your position in the pad, you only have to change one of your
feet, because the ups-downs and lefts-rights make two scales. In the big part of the song,
I did an almost perfect combination of basic freezes and hard jumps to make an advanced hard
6 feet. Also I left out the runs to mark the difference between this stepchart and heavy's
one. This is the perfect chart to the people that love the freezes, there are a lot of them.


++ HEAVY

Foot rating: StepMania estimate rate: 8.348955 || Own criteria: 9
Groove radar: 0.624 stream || 0.674 voltage || 0.439 air || 0.214 freeze || 0.118 chaos 
Steps: 388 notes || 20 hold notes

The stepchart starts with a basic run of ups-downs and lefts-rights that finish with a
little spin (if you watch it) before the first freeze that marks the beginning of the slow
part. This slow part is basically a lot of 4th jumps with 8th notes that combine with a slow
spin in the middle before continue with the jumps. Later, the second fast part is a combination
of advanced runs and many jumps that follow a lot the different sounds in the song, that explains
why in the middle of the runs and jumps appears some freezes notes. The most hard part is in 
the end, where I put some 12th notes between the vertical jumps.

++ ABOUT ME

I'm a cool guy thanks.

Really, I don't have nothing special to say about me. I'm a normal guy, that love DDR and
StepMania, I'm in my last year of school before enter in the university, I like play voleyball
and go out with my friends and have fun or go to parties. Well, if you understand spanish 
language, you can take a look in my blog at http://ncdx.blogspot.com/.

I started to play DDR 3 years ago, since May 2002. Later, in November of the same year,
a friend told me about a DDR game that was available in computers called StepMania. I wanted
to know how was it, and I downloaded it with some cool songs by BeMaNiRULER to start. Since that
moment, I was interested in do my own stepfiles, so I did. The first try was Played a-live
which was very awful. I continued trying to improve my quality but I couldn't, till a friend
called MAIK taught me how to do a great stepfile, and thanks to him, I found the way to do
great pieces to my StepMania. My first official stepfile was Ocean of Memories (Trance Mix),
which received a good critique of some good stepfile authors. So I continued and continued,
doing stepfiles and improving my quality. But came a moment that I thought that my work wasn't
sufficient, until I knew nDDRo, that it's one of my influences and I took some tips and 
techniques from them to start again with a new stepfile "serie" or "mix", that I called
DWI.SKYMIX, and this is where I am now.

These are some of my entries in competitions:
