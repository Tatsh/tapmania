TapMania is the iPhone's version of StepMania.

IMPORTANT:
	Linux Makefile compatibility is not supported since may 2009. I'm now running MacOSX everywhere so I don't use Linux with the open toolchain anymore.

HOWTO COMPILE VORBIS AND OGG:
	# create 'ext' directory in the root of tapmania project
	# download libvorbis-1.2.0 and libogg-1.1.3 and extract them into 'ext' directory.
	# configure and compile both using ./configure && make && sudo make install
	# TapMania should now compile fine using Xcode

THANKS:
	Thanks to all people involved in StepMania development for their great game which inspired me to create TapMania.
