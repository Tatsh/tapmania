most important:
1) need to make rendering and logic calculation apart of each other. 
most likely rendering must be done as a for(;;) loop in a separate thread and same thing must be done for
both input handling routines and game logic calculations.

clarification for myself:
Renderable - Protocol which should be implemented by objects which wish to be rendered 
LogicUpdater - Protocol which should be implemented by objects which wish to update game logic
*Renderer - A screen which is capable to hold and render renderables
TMRunLoop - A class which is running in a separate thread and can have registered renderables and LogicUpdaters 
the registered things will be invoked with regard of priorities which are set while one adds the stuff into the runloop. 
one should run a runloop for both renderers and logic updaters.


3) calculate accurate hit times and values
6) add some time like 3 seconds before the actual song starts.. with some graphics like ready/steady/GO
7) possibility to get back to menu after song ended
8) calculate score into TMScore (total score and counters for marv/perf/great etc.)
9) add screen to show scores after song ends. tap screen (or back button?) to continue
10) rewrite joyPad so that it works even while you slide your finger from one section to another
11) support for spread/index joyPad. this is not what currently is implemented. must be done differently to get the most space for fingers.
12) selectable setting for spread/index in Options
