most important:
1) need to make rendering and logic calculation apart of each other. 
most likely rendering must be done as a for(;;) loop in a separate thread and same thing must be done for
both input handling routines and game logic calculations.

3) calculate accurate hit times and values
6) add some time like 3 seconds before the actual song starts.. with some graphics like ready/steady/GO
7) possibility to get back to menu after song ended
8) calculate score into TMScore (total score and counters for marv/perf/great etc.)
9) add screen to show scores after song ends. tap screen (or back button?) to continue
10) rewrite joyPad so that it works even while you slide your finger from one section to another
11) support for spread/index joyPad. this is not what currently is implemented. must be done differently to get the most space for fingers.
12) selectable setting for spread/index in Options
