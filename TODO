todo file. written on 12 nov 2008 / last update on 10 dec 2008

1) PARTLY DONE. write code to handle hold arrow update/render in song play
2) rewrite joyPad so that it works even while you slide your finger from one section to another
3) calculate accurate hit times and values
4) add joyPad functionality to the song play renderer so that we can already hit notes
5) support for hold arrows in joyPad handling
6) all explosion effects for receptor arrows (while hitting on time)
7) DONE. add some time like 3 seconds before the actual song starts.. 
7.1) some graphics like ready/steady/GO before the song starts
8) DONE. possibility to get back to menu after song ended
9) calculate score into TMScore (total score and counters for marv/perf/great etc.)
10) add screen to show scores after song ends. tap screen (or back button?) to continue
11) support for spread/index joyPad. this is not what currently is implemented. must be done differently to get the most space for fingers.
12) selectable setting for spread/index in Options
13) animation of receptor row (beat)
14) animate hit accuracy (eg. great/perfect/marv. etc.) on screen realtime
15) animate OK/NG for held/lost hold arrows

future:
50) fonts support
51) add lua. use lua in noteskins/themes/fonts
