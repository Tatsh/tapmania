/* 
 This is my alternative to SoundEngine by Apple. 
 The code is inspired by the great OpenAL tutorial by hhamm (http://gehacktes.net/2009/03/iphone-programming-part-6-multiple-sounds-with-openal)
 Apple's SoundEngine was great but it didn't support .ogg and changing the code there was a pain for me.
 
 This sound engine should support both .mp3 and .ogg. (Unfortunatly it seems like .ogg is out of support by Apple atm. have to wait a bit)
